/**
 * spend.mjs — the story spend gate (park point H2).
 *
 * Stories run REAL spawns. They never set `FORGE_ARCHITECT_NO_SPAWN` (1.0.md
 * §3.1), so this gate is the only thing between `npm run stories` and the
 * operator's money.
 *
 * It is pure, and the runner evaluates it BEFORE any lock, bridge or browser
 * work, so a refusal costs nothing. Two independent declarations mean money —
 * `realSpawn` and a non-zero `budget_usd` — and either one alone is enough to
 * require approval. A story declaring a spawn at a zero budget is
 * mis-declared, and the safe reading of a mis-declared story is that it spends.

/**
 * What a run actually spent — bead `forge-8vfn.6.11.8`.
 *
 * Four H6 runs dispatched real agents and every one reported UNMEASURED.
 * Session 7 settled the class by measuring its opposite: three healthy
 * architect turns each priced themselves on their own `end` event ($0.3844,
 * $0.3870, $0.5358), while the ONE turn that hung was reaped mid-turn, wrote no
 * terminal event, and so had nothing to price. UNMEASURED was never a pricing
 * bug — it is the shape of a reaped turn.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT MATTERS IS THE NEGATIVE ONE. A run that DISPATCHED and produced
 * no priced event reports UNMEASURED with a reason, never `$0.00`: a zero
 * meaning "nothing was spent" and a zero meaning "nobody looked" must never
 * print the same, and this milestone has already paid for that confusion once.
 *
 * `usd` is `null` rather than `0` when unmeasured, so a caller cannot add it to
 * a total by accident.
