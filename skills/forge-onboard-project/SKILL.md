description: Bring any code project up to the forge↔Studio project contract so forge can develop it unattended at roadmap scale. Use before pointing forge at a new or not-yet-primed managed project. Works for any form — UI app, HTTP API, library, CLI, monorepo, infra provider — by authoring the project as a Studio object, mapping each operational contract invariant onto that project's shape, then validating (forge preflight + UI readiness) and handing off a roadmap-scale initiative. The contract spec is docs/forge-project-contract.md (ADR-034).

# Onboard a project to the forge↔Studio contract

Forge develops a project as an **unattended loop** (plan → change → verify →
package → review → merge) with no human in the inner loop. Onboarding makes the
guarantees a human would otherwise provide **structurally true of the project**.
Those guarantees are the contract in `docs/forge-project-contract.md` (ADR-034) —
read it first; this skill operationalises *getting a project there*.

The contract now has **two faces that must both be green**:
- **Face A — the Studio object** (`.forge/project.json`, authored/edited in the UI
  project builder, checked by `ContractReadiness`): `northStar`, `instructions`,
  `demoProcess`, `skills`, `kb`.
- **Face B — the operational clauses** (`forge preflight`): C1–C9 + DEMO + BRAIN.

A project is **flow-ready** only when both are satisfied (the UI's
`data-flow-ready` requires all five Studio-field checks AND zero failing hard
preflight clauses). Don't shrink the eventual initiative to dodge a gap — fix the
gap; the target is roadmap-scale decomposition.

## Procedure

### Step 0 — Secrets, before anything else
If the project carries any creds/secret file, **gitignore it and verify by exit
code** (`git check-ignore -q <file>`). Map its keys to the env vars the app reads;
prove them with one read-only live call.

### Step 1 — Choose the committed-artifact home (`artifactRoot`)
Decide where the project's COMMITTED forge artifacts live. Default `"."` keeps the
legacy layout (`brain/` at the project root). For a single visible home out of the
source tree, set `"artifactRoot": "forge"` in `.forge/project.json` — then:
- `forge/brain/` — Brain 3 (`profile.md` + `themes/`).
- `forge/history/<initiative-id>/` — the committed development record (plan + demo).
- `forge/skills/` — the project-action skills.
`artifactRoot` must be a clean relative path (no leading `/`, no `..`). Runtime
scratch (`_architect/`, worktree `demo/<id>/`, `.forge/` runtime dir) stays
gitignored regardless.

### Step 2 — Author the project as a Studio object (Face A)
Set in `.forge/project.json` (or via the UI project builder):
- `northStar` — one-line mission (≤140 chars).
- `instructions` — positive standing directives ("what TO do") injected into every
  agent; reference the project's conventions, the skill paths, and the history
  convention.
- `demoProcess` — typed steps with ≥1 `capture` and ≥1 `verify` (a `present` is
  good too) describing how the behavioural delta is shown.
- `skills` — the project-action skill slugs (Step 6).
- `kb` — the bound knowledge base id (the project brain).
ContractReadiness checks these five; all must pass for flow-ready.

### Step 3 — Assess the operational clauses (Face B)
Run `forge preflight <project>` (C1–C9 + DEMO + BRAIN). Then **manually check the
facets preflight does not enforce**:
- C1 *discrimination*: run the gate on a clean tree — it must **fail** (no work
  yet). If it passes, it's hollow and is rejected at iter-0.
- C2 *hermeticity*: build, then `git status` — anything but intended source is a gap.
- C1b *CI alignment*: the per-WI gate must be the CI command or a strict subset it
  subsumes (`ci_gate`) — never narrower than the project's merge bar.
- DEMO *fidelity*: run the demo on baseline vs HEAD and eyeball that it captures the
  delta, not just that a shape exists.
- C9 *fixtures*: non-default values for every field under test, create/update
  verified via a separate read-back call.
Record every gap; the rest closes them.

### Step 4 — Truthful done-signal (C1)
A gate that is fast, deterministic, green at HEAD, and **scoped to the unit of
change** (empty ⇒ fail / real-work ⇒ pass). Map to the form (UI render test • API
contract test • library/CLI unit test • monorepo package-scoped gate — never a
repo-wide wildcard). Declare as ONE command in `.forge/quality_gate_cmd` +
`.forge/project.json`. Verify fail-then-pass by hand.

### Step 5 — Hermetic change-capture (C2)
`.gitignore` so `git add -A` captures only intended source: forge scratch
(`.forge/`, `AGENT.md`, `PROMPT.md`, `fix_plan.md`), build artifacts + generated
output (binaries, bundles, coverage), and force-track required config inside an
ignored dir (`.forge/project.json`). Acceptance: clean build ⇒ `git status` shows
nothing but intended source. **Note:** `<artifactRoot>/` itself (brain, history,
skills) IS committed.

### Step 6 — Project-action skills (under `<artifactRoot>/skills/`)
Capture the project's recurring actions as skills forge agents read by path:
e.g. scaffold a resource, explore an API, run the demo, refactor a schema. Bind
them via `skills` in `.forge/project.json` and reference their paths in the
agent-instruction file. These are the "consistent actions forge takes" on this
project.

### Step 7 — Prime the brain & roadmap (C4)
Author `roadmap.md` (project root) + an accurate `<artifactRoot>/brain/profile.md`
+ any `themes/`. **Correct stale facts** (renamed paths, dead conventions) — a
wrong brain misleads the planner worse than an absent one. The profile is the
queryable structure the PM/architect reads first.

### Step 8 — Untouchables, merge model, instruction file (C5/C6/C8)
A human-authored `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` at the project root with **exact build/
test/lint invocations near the top** + positive directives + the skill paths + the
history convention. Forge must never auto-author it. Confirm a GitHub remote and
that PRs won't need to stack.

### Step 9 — Committed development-history convention
Every initiative leaves a browsable record at
`<artifactRoot>/history/<initiative-id>/` — the plan (`plan.md`), the demo
evidence (`demo/`), and the verdict. The project's `instructions` + agents write
this into the worktree as part of the work so it lands in the PR and is committed.
This is a project-side convention (forge does not hard-code it) — state it in the
instruction file and back it with a `present` `demoProcess` step.

### Step 10 — Demo-ability (the demo-design skill)
The review phase must *show* the operator the one behavioural delta. Declare
`demoProcess` in `.forge/project.json` with ≥1 `capture` step and ≥1 `verify`
step describing what evidence to record and what assertion makes it non-trivial.
Then **run the `demo-design` skill** — it reads `demoProcess` + the project's
actual code, assesses the right evidence form (portal/browser screenshot
opportunistically when a renderable surface exists, harness metrics when a
measurement command exists, live external API round-trip when the code calls a
live system, JSON-diff/notes-only by default), and **generates** the per-project
demo machinery committed into the project repo. **Write it to the FIXED path
`.forge/skills/demo-design/SKILL.md`** (slug pinned to `demo-design`, not a
descriptive name) so the scorecard can verify it deterministically — `forge
preflight` has a `DEMO-SKILL` clause that WARNs until this file exists. Ensure a
valid prior state (baseline doesn't error). The generated skill encodes the
exhaustive discipline for live-external projects (every option exercised,
round-trip proof, idempotency gate, clean destroy). **Confirm `forge preflight
<project>` reports `DEMO-SKILL` ✓ before considering onboarding done.**

### Step 11 — External-resource model (C7, only if needed)
If behaviour can only be verified live: a creds-free in-loop gate (mocks/in-process)
plus a confirmation layer (create→confirm→destroy, prefixed/randomized names,
orphan sweep, creds out-of-band → env). Make the per-WI testing contract structural
via three `.forge/project.json` seams:
- **`acceptance_gate: { match, required, requires_env }`** — `match` identifies the
  live-acc suite in a WI gate; `required: true` hard-fails the cycle if no live-acc
  WI; `requires_env` errors fast (not false-pass) when creds are absent.
- **`standing_work_item_acs: [...]`** — the live-proof AC (apply → API-read assert →
  idempotency re-plan → clean destroy) + the CI-equivalent push AC, appended to every WI.
- **`ci_gate_unset_env: [...]`** — env to strip so `ci_gate` mirrors GitHub CI even
  though the serve env sets the live-test trigger.
Compose the project linter into the live-acc per-WI gate (its gate is the acceptance
test, which omits lint). Enforce C9 on the live tier: UUID-prefixed resources,
teardown on success AND failure, a `PreCheck` that `t.Fatal`s on absent creds, a
read-back assertion on every written field.

### Step 11.5 — Release process & CI release workflow (C10, only if the project releases)
If the project ships versioned releases (a library, CLI, provider, or any package
consumers depend on a version of), opt into the release flow by declaring
**`releaseProcess`** in `.forge/project.json` (see
`studio/starters/project.json.example`):
- **`changelogPath`** — the changelog file (default `CHANGELOG.md`). Seed it with a
  `## [Unreleased]` heading if absent.
- **`steps`** — `{ kind: docs|changelog|version, phase: in-cycle|pre-merge, text,
  command? }`. At minimum a `changelog`/`in-cycle` step (the DRAFT every WI writes)
  and the `pre-merge` steps the finaliser runs (doc regen, version bump). Map each
  to the project's real tool (the `command`).
- **`versionFile` / `docsDir`** — where the version lives and where docs live.

Then **install the release CI workflow**: copy
`studio/starters/release-workflow.yml.example` to
`<project>/.github/workflows/release.yml`, fill the two TODO knobs (how to read the
committed version; optional publish). Forge SHIPS this workflow but NEVER runs
tag/publish — CI owns that off merge-to-main. The forge release-finalizer commits
the finalised changelog + version bump to the PR branch before merge; the workflow
tags + releases on merge.

Map the release process: draft (in-cycle) + finalise (pre-merge) + the CI workflow
must all be present for the clause to be satisfied.

### Step 12 — Validate, then hand off roadmap-scale
Both faces green: `forge preflight` passes (hard clauses) AND the UI readiness shows
flow-ready; the gate verified fail-then-pass on a clean tree; a hermetic build. Then
give forge a **multi-feature, roadmap-scale** initiative (the roadmap decomposed).
Watch the first cycle; if it misbehaves, diagnose the contract gap rather than
narrowing scope.

## Done = the project meets both faces of the contract
A project that is flow-ready (preflight hard clauses + the five Studio-field checks),
its committed forge artifacts homed under `<artifactRoot>/`, the brain accurate, the
history convention in place — ready for forge to decompose roadmap-scale work.
