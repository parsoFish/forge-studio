/**
 * Single source of truth for forge-side brain filesystem paths.
 *
 * The three-brain restructure (2026-05-26, ADR 018) moved several brain
 * directories. Before this module, the new locations were re-derived ad hoc
 * with `resolve(...)`/`join(...)` in half a dozen modules, and a later
 * rename left some readers pointing at directories that no longer exist
 * (e.g. the empty `brain/_raw/cycles/`). Route every brain-path lookup
 * through here so a future move is a one-file change.
 *
 * Layout (forge repo) — ADR 035: per-project brain + history + contract are
 * forge-owned and CENTRAL (no longer in the managed project's repo):
 *   brain/cycles/themes/                  — Brain 2: forge-level cycle-derived themes
 *   brain/cycles/_raw/                     — Brain 2: raw cycle archives
 *   brain/forge-dev/                       — Brain 1: forge engineering knowledge
 *   brain/projects/<name>/themes/          — Brain 3: per-project themes (central)
 *   project-artifacts/<name>/demo-history/<init>/ — archived dev/demo history (central)
 *   project-artifacts/<name>/contract.json — resolved forge↔project contract (central SSOT)
 *
 * The in-PR demo dir (`projectDemoRelDir`) stays WORKTREE-relative — it is the
 * demo the unifier authors into the PR, not the post-merge archive. `artifactRoot`
 * (project.json) now governs only that in-repo demo location.

 * - any other `artifactRoot` → `<artifactRoot>/history/<initiativeId>/demo`, so a

 * as a filesystem segment AND as display text in prompts; callers `resolve(...)`
 * it against the worktree root when they need an absolute path. The same
 * path-escape guard `readArtifactRoot` applies means the segment is always clean.
